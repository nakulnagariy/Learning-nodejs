It's a security restriction of the Windows PowerShell.

=============
Setting up SSH keys to github

TO transfer the code from our machine/github to third party app (heroku) in a secure way, we use SSH (Secure shell).

to check if we already have the SSH keys, we need to open the git bash in the project directory(fir windows)
commond: ls -a -l ~/.ssh
ls: used for to list out the files in the directory.
-a: to show the hidden files.
-l: to show in the list manner.
~/.ssh: type of file we are searching for.

if we have the SSH keys, will see something like below:

=========
total 33
drwxr-xr-x 1 ASUS 197609    0 Jan 13 08:27 ./
drwxr-xr-x 1 ASUS 197609    0 Apr 19 18:47 ../
-rw-r--r-- 1 ASUS 197609 1679 Oct 15  2017 github_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 ASUS 197609  402 Oct 15  2017 github_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 ASUS 197609  802 Jan 13 08:28 known_hosts
==========

where as github_rsa is private key and github_rsa.pub is public key.

or if we don't have the key, we can generate the key by following commonds:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "nagariya23nakul@gmail.com"

ssh-keygen: is the main commond to generate the key.
-t: is asking for which type of key we want in out case its 'rsa'.
-b: means how many bits key we want, in our case its 4096.
-C: is for comment in which we can give our mail id.
